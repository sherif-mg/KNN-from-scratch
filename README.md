# K-Nearest Neighbors (K-NN) Algorithm

## Overview

K-Nearest Neighbors (K-NN) is a simple, non-parametric, and lazy learning algorithm used for both classification and regression tasks. It works by finding the `k` nearest data points in the training set to a given query point and making predictions based on these neighbors. Despite its simplicity, K-NN is highly effective for various machine learning problems.

## Features

- **Classification and Regression**: Support for both classification and regression tasks.
- **Distance Metrics**: Configurable distance metrics (e.g., Euclidean, Manhattan).
- **Normalization**: Optional feature scaling to improve performance.
- **Cross-Validation**: Built-in support for k-fold cross-validation to tune hyperparameters.
